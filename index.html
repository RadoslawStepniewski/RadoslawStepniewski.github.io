                            Vendetta, and many titles under their alternative imprint Vertigo.

                            The initials "DC" came from the company's popular series Detective Comics, which featured
                            Batman's
                            debut and subsequently became part of the company's name. Originally in Manhattan at 432
                            Fourth
                            Avenue, the DC Comics offices have been located at 480 and later 575 Lexington Avenue; 909
                            Third
                            Avenue; 75 Rockefeller Plaza; 666 Fifth Avenue; and 1325 Avenue of the Americas. DC had its
                            headquarters at 1700 Broadway, Midtown Manhattan, New York City, but it was announced in
                            October
                            2013 that DC Entertainment would relocate its headquarters from New York to Burbank,
                            California
                            in
                            2015.

                            its
                            major, longtime competitor Marvel Comics (acquired in 2009 by The Walt Disney Company, Time
                            Warner's
