                    <strong>DC Comics.</strong> is an American comic book publisher. It is the publishing
                    unit of DC
                    Entertainment, a subsidiary of Warner Bros. Entertainment, Inc., a division of Time Warner.
                    DC
                    Comics is one of the largest and oldest American comic book companies, and produces material
                    featuring numerous well-known heroic characters including Superman, Batman, Wonder Woman,
                    Green
                    Lantern, The Flash, Aquaman, Black Canary, Hawkman, Supergirl, Hawkgirl, Green Arrow,
                    Martian
                    Manhunter, Cyborg, Static, Zatanna, and Shazam. Most of their material takes place in the
                    fictional
                    DC Universe, which also features teams such as the Justice League, the Justice Society of
                    America,
                    the Suicide Squad, and the Teen Titans, and well-known villains such as the Joker, Lex
                    Luthor,
                    The
                    Cheetah, Darkseid, Catwoman, Ra's al Ghul, Deathstroke, Reverse-Flash, Sinestro, Black Adam,
                    and
                    Brainiac. The company has also published non-DC Universe-related material, including
                    Watchmen, V
                    for
                    Vendetta, and many titles under their alternative imprint Vertigo.

                    The initials "DC" came from the company's popular series Detective Comics, which featured
                    Batman's
                    debut and subsequently became part of the company's name. Originally in Manhattan at 432
                    Fourth
                    Avenue, the DC Comics offices have been located at 480 and later 575 Lexington Avenue; 909
                    Third
                    Avenue; 75 Rockefeller Plaza; 666 Fifth Avenue; and 1325 Avenue of the Americas. DC had its
                    headquarters at 1700 Broadway, Midtown Manhattan, New York City, but it was announced in
                    October
                    2013 that DC Entertainment would relocate its headquarters from New York to Burbank,
                    California
                    in
                    2015.

                    Random House distributes DC Comics' books to the bookstore market,[citation needed] while
                    Diamond
                    Comic Distributors supplies the comics shop specialty market.[citation needed] DC Comics and
                    its
                    major, longtime competitor <em>Marvel Comics</em> (acquired in 2009 by The Walt Disney
                    Company, Time
                    Warner's
                    main competitor) together shared 70% of the American comic book market in 2016.
